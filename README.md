This Decision Wheel Web App has simple features and functionalities. This allows the users to add their choices to the wheel dynamically. The data are stored using the localStorage. The system generates a random background color for each choice or item. The item container in the wheel are automatically generated by the system and the sizes are depending on how many items are added. The user can simply click the 'SPIN' button to spin or rotate the wheel to a random degree.
